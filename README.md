This project examines the profound impact of deforestation in the Amazon rainforest on biodiversity loss and the resulting increase in extreme weather events. The Amazon, often described as the “lungs of the Earth,” is not only a repository of unparalleled species diversity but also a crucial regulator of the global climate. However, rapid deforestation—primarily driven by agricultural expansion, logging, and urban development—has led to a significant reduction in forest cover. This loss undermines the forest’s natural ability to sequester carbon dioxide, intensifying global warming and destabilizing local and regional weather patterns.

By investigating the extent to which deforestation contributes to the decline in biodiversity and the escalation of weather disasters, this study addresses a critical environmental challenge. The research focuses on data from key regions within Brazil and Bolivia, where deforestation rates are particularly high due to land conversion for cattle ranching and soy production. Using Python-based analytical methods, the project integrates high-resolution remote sensing data, ecological indicators, and climate models to quantify deforestation trends and assess their ecological and meteorological impacts.

The theoretical framework for the study explains how forests maintain regional rainfall patterns through transpiration which underscores the risks of exceeding critical environmental thresholds. These frameworks provide context for understanding how forest fragmentation and reduced canopy cover can lead to increased incidences of drought, flooding, and wildfires.

Ultimately, the project aims to provide robust empirical evidence that links deforestation with biodiversity decline and weather instability. The insights gained are intended to inform policy-makers and environmental managers, advocating for sustainable land-use practices and conservation strategies to preserve the Amazon’s vital ecological functions and mitigate the adverse effects of climate change.
